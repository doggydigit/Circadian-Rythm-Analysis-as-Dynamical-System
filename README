This README will lead you through our matlab code and explain how to use it to reproduce our results.

For most Exercises please simply refer to function named after them.
It was decided to design a motherfunction for the exercises 10 to 15, which would simplify the analysis of the model with varying parameters.
This is synthesized in the function "Ex10_to_15", which can be called by simply typing the command:

>> Ex10_to_15

How to interpret it should be self-explanatory ;)

Exercises 16,17,24,25 and 26 all have their individual function. For more information on how to use them please refer to their individual help instructions by entering:

>> help 'namefunction'

A second supplementary function for Exercise 25 was also implemented allowing to change the Îµ parameter as well as the period of the external cycle T and observe those effects on the histograms.

Simply enter the command >>Histoto and enjoy this wonderful experience!
